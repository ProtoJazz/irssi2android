Irssi2Android - send notifications from irssi to your Android phone
===================================================================

This simple script allows you to get notifications about your private messages from irssi to your Android phone. Currently this supports only the Notify My Android (www.notifymyandroid.com) api. The NMA application costs currently around 3.5 eur.

The script sends events only when you have not done anything (pressed any buttons) for a predefined idle time (Default 60, tune with /set irssi2android_idletime <minutes>). In my opinion this is much better than depending on your /away status.

I'd suggest that you also use the excellent Irssi Connectbot: https://market.android.com/details?id=org.woltage.irssiconnectbot

Installation
============

1) Copy the irssi2android.pl under your scripts directory (Usually ~/.irssi/scripts).
2) Load the script: /script load irssi2android
3) Set your NMA apikey: /set irssi2android_nma_api 123456789abcdef
4) Send a test message: /irssi2android Hello, World!
